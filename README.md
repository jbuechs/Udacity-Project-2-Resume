## What did I learn in this project?

While completing this project, I learned how to manipulate the DOM using javascript and jQuery. I used the replace function
a lot in order to edit the html in the helper.js file.

I also learned what JSON is, some of the differences between bracket and dot notation, and pretty much everything else. I did not know any javascript before taking this class so it was all new. The way functions are objects in javascript is kind of foreign to me and will probably be kind of confusing until it makes sense.

### What I still need to learn:
Well, I'm a major newbie so I still need to learn everything. But specifically, I am not sure what in the project was jQuery and what was javascript. I have a book on javascript I will use to learn more about js. I also am looking forward to taking the next Udacity class, Intro to jQuery.
